**Repository content**
This repository contains the implementation of the two-stage framework introduced in the paper along with the results for the respective case studies. We implemented the framework in python (see files in the [two_stage_framework](https://github.com/TihanyiD/multi_alloc/tree/master/two_stage_framework) folder) and provided a visual studio project [solution](https://github.com/TihanyiD/multi_alloc/blob/master/two_stage_framework.sln).

Overview
----

The purpose of the framework is to generate control policies for the robots which maximizes the probability of avoiding the evolving hazard while visiting the known target locations. This requires both the allocation of targets between the robots and the generation of paths for them. 

By using the implementation presented in this repository, one can create new example environments and obtain solutions for them, or plot the pre-computed results of existing case studies.

Examining existing case studies
----

Follow the instructions below:

* Open the ["two_stage_framework.py"](https://github.com/TihanyiD/multi_alloc/blob/master/two_stage_framework/two_stage_framework.py) file.

* Make sure that the following flag is set to "True".

```
open_case_study=True
```

* Choose the case study by modifying the following line of code. Available case studies: "case_study_1", "example_2_1", "example_2_2", "example_3_1", "example_3_2".

```
example_name="case_study_1"
```

* Run the code.

The code generates the map of the example with the initial state of the hazard sources and the robots. The code then loads the pre-computed results. They are shown in the command line. The generated robot paths are shown in figures.

Creating a new example
----

Follow the instructions below:

* Open the ["two_stage_framework.py"](https://github.com/TihanyiD/multi_alloc/blob/master/two_stage_framework/two_stage_framework.py) file.

* Make sure that the following flag is set to "False".

```
open_case_study=False
```

* Choose the name of the example you want to create by modifying the following line of code.

```
example_name="case_study_1"
```

* Set up the map of the example by modifying the following line of code. The variable "parameters.map" should be a 2 dimensional binary "numpy" array where an entry of 1 represents an obstacle in the environment.

```
parameters.map=np.array([[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1],
                         [1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1],
                         [1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],
                         [1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1],
                         [1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1],
                         [1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
                         [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1],
                         [1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
                         [1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
                         [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0],
                         [1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
                         [1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1],
                         [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1]])
```

* Set up the targets by modifying the following lines of code. The variable "parameters.targets" should be a list containing tuples of coordinates representing the target locations on the map. A valid coordinate should be within the range of the map and not conside with an obstacle. The variable "parameters.task_ids" should be a list of strings containing target labels.

```
parameters.targets=[(3,9),(5,1),(8,6),(11,11),(14,1)]
parameters.task_ids=["i","ii","iii","iv","v"]
```

* Set up the robots by modifying the following lines of code. The variable "parameters.robot_positions" should be a list containing tuples of coordinates representing the initial robot locations on the map. A valid coordinate should be within the range of the map and not conside with an obstacle. Variables "parameters.robot_ids" and "parameters.robot_linestyles" should be lists containing robot labels and path line styles.

```
parameters.robot_positions=[(0,6),(8,12),(10,0)]
parameters.robot_ids=["1","2","3"]
parameters.robot_linestyles=[(0,()),(0,(3,3)),(0,(1,2))]
```

* Set up the hazards by modifying the following lines of code. The variable "parameters.y_0" should be a list of lists, where each sub-list contains tuples of coordinates representing the initial state of a particular hazard source. Multiple cell coordinates can be added for each hazard source. A valid coordinate should be within the range of the map and not conside with an obstacle. Variables "parameters.hazard_ids" and "parameters.p_f" should be lists containing hazard labels and spreading speed parameters (float between 0 and 1 -- the higher the value the higher the change for the hazard to spread to a neighbouring cell).

```
parameters.y_0=[[(13,12)],[(2,1)],[(11,2)],[(3,11)],[(13,6)]]
parameters.hazard_ids=["a","b","c","d","e"]
parameters.p_f=[0.002,0.004,0.012,0.012,0.012]
```

* Set up the goal positionby modifying the following line of code. The variable "parameters.goal" should be a tuple representing the coordinate of the goal position. A valid coordinate should be within the range of the map and not conside with an obstacle.

```
parameters.goal=(16,9)
```

* Set up the number of Monte-Carlo samples used to approximate the hazard spread. The variable "parameters.E" should be an integer representing the number of Monte-Carlo samples.
```
parameters.E=5000
```

* Set up the number of time steps for the dynamic programming algorithm. The variable "parameters.N" should be an integer representing the number of time steps.
```
parameters.N=75
```

* Set variable "parameters.p_stay=0" for a deterministic robot dynamics. Set a value between 0 and 1 for a non-deterministic robot dynamics. For example, if "parameters.p_stay=0.2", then the robot dynamics is defined as follows: the robot fails to move to the neighboring cells despite the control input and stays on the same cell with probability 0.2.
```
parameters.p_stay=0
```

* Run the code.

The code generates the map of the example with the initial state of the hazard sources and the robots (make sure to hid "close" for the program to move on). The code then loads the pre-computed results. They are shown in the command line. The generated robot paths are shown in figures.
